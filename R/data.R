#' Example Data from a Color Judgement Task
#'
#' Raw data from 50 subjects that completed a color judgement task. Participants
#' had to detect if there were more blue or red dots in a cloud of colored dots.
#' The task included a difficulty manipulation coded by the `condition` variable.
#' In the easy condition 60 percent of the dots were either blue or red, and in
#' the difficult condition 52 percent were either blue or red. In addition the
#' fixation cross preceding the onset of the dot matrix had a variable presentation
#' time coded in the `fix_duration` variable
